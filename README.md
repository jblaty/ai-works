# AI Works

Welcome to AI Works, a public workshop dedicated to the research and development of AI solutions that make a true difference for humans.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in a people-first approach to innovation. Rather than focusing solely on technology, we prioritize creating solutions that genuinely help people. We believe that the human element must be retained if humanity is to continue to create and evolve.

## What We Do

At AI Works, we explore the vast potential of artificial intelligence and how it can be harnessed to solve real-world problems. Our work spans various domains and industries, always with the aim of making a positive impact on people's lives.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in AI and its potential to change the world for the better. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a researcher, a developer, or someone who's just curious about AI, there's a place for you at AI Works.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to us. You can contact Joe Blaty at either of the following email addresses:
